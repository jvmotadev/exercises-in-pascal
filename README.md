# Pascal Exercises

- In this repository you will find some algorithm exercises in Pascal and other necessary files. In this course we use the [Pascalzim](http://pascalzimbr.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html) compiler.
- Many programs were created by the teacher and others were modified and created by me.
- You will also find teacher comments throughout the code.
